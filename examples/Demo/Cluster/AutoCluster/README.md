## AutoCluster Example

In this example we will run 2 NBomber instances (nodes) in the cluster mode.

- http_scenario will be executed on Coordinator
- http_scenario will be executed on Agent

You can take a look at `autocluster-config.json` config to check the ClusterSettings.

In order to run that demo you should spin-up NATS message broker via docker-compose CLI (there is `docker-compose.yaml`)

```
docker compose up
```
