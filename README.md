Would you like to help make NBomber even better? We keep a list of issues that are approachable for newcomers under the [good-first-issue](https://github.com/PragmaticFlow/NBomber/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) label.

## Why another {x} framework for load testing?
The main reasons are:
 - **To be technology agnostic** as much as possible (**no dependency on any protocol: HTTP, WebSockets, SSE etc**).
 - To be able to test .NET implementation of specific driver. During testing, it was identified many times that the performance could be slightly different because of the virtual machine(.NET, Java, PHP, Js, Erlang, different settings for GC) or just quality of drivers. For example there were cases that drivers written in C++ and invoked from NodeJs app worked faster than drivers written in C#/.NET. Therefore, it does make sense to load test your app using your concrete driver and runtime.

 ### What makes it very simple?
NBomber is not really a framework but rather a foundation of building blocks which you can use to describe your test scenario, run it and get reports.
```csharp
var step = Step.Create("step", async context =>
{
    // you can do any logic here: go to http, websocket etc

    await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(0.1));
    return Response.Ok();
});

var scenario = ScenarioBuilder.CreateScenario("Hello World!", new[] { step });

NBomberRunner.RegisterScenarios(scenario)
             .RunInConsole();
```
